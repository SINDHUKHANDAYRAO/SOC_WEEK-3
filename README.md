# SOC Week 3 â€” Post-Synthesis GLS & STA Fundamentals

This week, we worked on **Post-Synthesis Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** and gained hands-on experience with **Static Timing Analysis (STA)** using Yosys and OpenSTA.
We performed synthesis of the BabySoC design, validated functionality through GLS, and generated timing reports and graphs to understand path delays, setup/hold checks, and slack analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Task-wise Breakdown

### [Task 1 â€” Post-Synthesis GLS](https://github.com/SINDHUKHANDAYRAO/SOC_WEEK-3/blob/main/Task-1.md)

* Performed synthesis of BabySoC using Yosys.
* Ran Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) with the synthesized netlist.
* Compared GLS output with functional simulation from Week 2 to verify correctness.
* Delivered synthesis logs, GLS waveform screenshots, and a confirmation note for functional equivalence.

### [Task 2 â€” Fundamentals of STA (Static Timing Analysis)](https://github.com/SINDHUKHANDAYRAO/SOC_WEEK-3/blob/main/Task-2.md)

* Studied STA fundamentals including setup & hold analysis, slack, clock definitions, and path-based analysis.
* Learned about timing constraints, library delay models, timing checks, and path analysis.
* Created a one-page summary of STA concepts with graphical illustrations and practical examples.

### [Task 3 â€” Generate Timing Graphs with OpenSTA](https://github.com/SINDHUKHANDAYRAO/SOC_WEEK-3/blob/main/Task-3.md)

* Loaded the post-synthesis netlist and SDC constraints in OpenSTA.
* Generated timing graphs for setup and hold paths, slack, and clock skew.
* Analyzed critical paths and timing violations.
* Delivered OpenSTA input scripts, timing reports, slack analysis files, and graphical timing plots.

âœ… By the end of Week 3, we:

1. Performed post-synthesis GLS and validated design functionality.
2. Learned STA fundamentals and performed timing checks.
3. Generated timing graphs and identified critical paths using OpenSTA.

Do you want me to do that?
